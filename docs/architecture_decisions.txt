To enhance the POC of the UdaConnect project, I decided to propose the following solution. 
First, to find all people within a given distances must cause time delays because there is process of reaching all people and compare with each other record, so I decided to use REST + Kafka and in the communication between the ConnectService and PersonService gRPC. 
Then, the other message passing on the other services (Location Service and Person Service) is just REST because there is no complex processes involved among those requests.
