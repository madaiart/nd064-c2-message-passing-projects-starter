# UdaConnect
## Overview
### Background
Conferences and conventions are hotspots for making connections. Professionals in attendance often share the same interests and can make valuable business and personal connections with one another. At the same time, these events draw a large crowd and it's often hard to make these connections in the midst of all of these events' excitement and energy. To help attendees make connections, we are building the infrastructure for a service that can inform attendees if they have attended the same booths and presentations at an event.

### Goal
You work for a company that is building a app that uses location data from mobile devices. Your company has built a [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) application to ingest location data named UdaTracker. This POC was built with the core functionality of ingesting location and identifying individuals who have shared a close geographic proximity.

Management loved the POC so now that there is buy-in, we want to enhance this application. You have been tasked to enhance the POC application into a [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) to handle the large volume of location data that will be ingested.

To do so, ***you will refactor this application into a microservice architecture using message passing techniques that you have learned in this course***. It’s easy to get lost in the countless optimizations and changes that can be made: your priority should be to approach the task as an architect and refactor the application into microservices. File organization, code linting -- these are important but don’t affect the core functionality and can possibly be tagged as TODO’s for now!

## Running the app
The project has been set up such that you should be able to have the project up and running with Kubernetes.

### Prerequisites
We will be installing the tools that we'll need to use for getting our environment set up properly.
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Set up a DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/)
3. [Set up `kubectl`](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/cluster-access/kubectl/)
4. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) with at least version 6.0
5. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation) with at least version 2.0
6. **[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) with at least version 3.2.1**

### Environment Setup
To run the application, you will need a K8s cluster running locally and to interface with it via `kubectl`. We will be using Vagrant with VirtualBox to run K3s.

#### Initialize K3s
In this project's root, run `vagrant up`. 
```bash
$ vagrant up
```
The command will take a while and will leverage VirtualBox to load an [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) OS and automatically install [K3s](https://k3s.io/). When we are taking a break from development, we can run `vagrant suspend` to conserve some ouf our system's resources and `vagrant resume` when we want to bring our resources back up. Some useful vagrant commands can be found in [this cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/wpscholar/a49594e2e2b918f4d0c4).

#### Set up `kubectl`
After `vagrant up` is done, you will SSH into the Vagrant environment and retrieve the Kubernetes config file used by `kubectl`. We want to copy the contents of this file into our local environment so that `kubectl` knows how to communicate with the K3s cluster.
```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```
You will now be connected inside of the virtual OS. Run `sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to print out the contents of the file. You should see output similar to the one that I've shown below. Note that the output below is just for your reference: every configuration is unique and you should _NOT_ copy the output I have below.

Copy the contents from the output issued from your own command into your clipboard -- we will be pasting it somewhere soon!
```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

apiVersion: v1

```
Type `exit` to exit the virtual OS and you will find yourself back in your computer's session. Create the file (or replace if it already exists) `~/.kube/config` and paste the contents of the `k3s.yaml` output here.

Afterwards, you can test that `kubectl` works by running a command like `kubectl describe services`. It should not return any errors.

### Steps
Each microservice is located into the root directory, more specifically into the modules folder

Deploy each microservice in the following order:

#### SETTING UP A KAFKA

**1. Now, you can add the chart repository below.**
```shell
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

$ helm repo list

NAME        	URL                                           
bitnami     	https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami            
```

**2. Install the kafka helm chart**
```shell
$ helm install kafka-release bitnami/kafka           

```

**3. After a while, check that kafka is running inside Kubernetes cluster entering the commands below:**

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kafka-release-zookeeper-0   1/1     Running   0          45m10s
kafka-release-0             1/1     Running   1          45m10s
```

Now, you will be able to deploy the services.
For a better understanding, check the architectural diagram
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fthiagomedeiros/cloud-native-architecture-udaconnect-project/development/docs/architecture_design.png "Architectural Diagram -  Now you have set up a Kafka component.")

#### Run-Microservices
1. `$ kubectl apply -f deployment/`
2. When the pods are running, seed database
    `sh /scripts/run_db_command.sh <POSTGRES_DB_POD_NAME>`
   The step 2 will populate the postgres database **_(The pod name will be something like (postgres-xxxxx))_**

### Verifying it Works
Once the project is up and running, you should be able to send requests to grpc location-event-microservice
`kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services` - should both return `udaconnect-app`, `udaconnect-api`, and `postgres`

These pages should also load on your web browser:
* `http://localhost:30002/` - OpenAPI Documentation
* `http://localhost:30002/api/persons/1/connection?start_date=2020-01-01&end_date=2020-12-30&distance=5`
* `http://localhost:30001/api/persons` - Base path for person microservice API
* `http://localhost:30000/` - Frontend ReactJS Application

To send records, please execute the python file for location-event-microservice
[grpc-client](https://github.com/fthiagomedeiros/cloud-native-architecture-udaconnect-project/blob/development/modules/03-location-event-microservice/location-event-client-grpc.py)

<span style="color:red">When running the grpc_client, please in the field userId try to insert valid data from API http://127.0.0.1:30001/api/persons, which userId values are 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600. **I am not validating the userId when send a request to location-event-microservice**. You may insert a new user and you will be able to test this new user</span>.
